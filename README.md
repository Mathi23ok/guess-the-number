Guess the Number
This is a simple Python program where you try to guess a randomly generated number. You have 5 chances to guess the correct number.

How It Works

The program uses Pythonâ€™s random library to generate a random number.
You start with 5 lives (attempts).
After each guess, the program tells you whether your guess is too low or too high.
If you guess correctly, you win! Otherwise, the game continues until you run out of lives.
Once you reach the maximum number of guesses, the program terminates.

How to Run the Program

Ensure you have Python installed.
Run the script using a Python interpreter.
Follow the prompts to enter your guesses.
